# Responsive Login Page

This is my **first HTML and CSS project** where I built a **responsive login page**. The goal of this project was to practice and improve my skills in basic web development, particularly in creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Features
- Responsive design, optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.
- Clean and simple HTML structure.
- Styled with CSS for a visually appealing look.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or use the code for your own projects!
